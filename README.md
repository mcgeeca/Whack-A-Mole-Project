# Whack-A-Mole-Project

Hello all and welcome to my repository of my code for this project.  The install.sh file has all of the necessary packages that you need to install before using the code.  You must source the setup.sh page before using the Whack-A-Mole.py file.  Make sure that the authorization code that is in the setup.sh file is the same authorization code that is on the Blynk App.  After sourcing run the python file to start the game.  For more information on the project please feel free to look at my elinux page and my hackster.io page.  Happy playing!
